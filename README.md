Cmpe131 Application Project created by Anna Cui, Jo√£o Carlos Prado, Michael Ancheta, Nick Castro.
Our group, group 6, will use this platform to make an application available on android phones that will be used as a database to remember the user's passwords for their login in other applications.
We will be coding on android studio and transfering the code to GitHub where we can all collaborate.
